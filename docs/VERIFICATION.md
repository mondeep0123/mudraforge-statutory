## 1. Scope & Epistemic Limitations

In enterprise software and autonomous compliance systems, **a passing test suite is evidence of conformance under tested conditions—it is not an absolute judicial proof that every statutory interpretation or real-world edge case is correct**.

This report documents:
1. The reproducible public test commands used to verify OKF schemas, circular frontmatter, and temporal state transitions.
2. The differential tests used to check statutory threshold calculations against published legal sources.
3. The cryptographic integrity checks certifying that bundled local files match the published release byte-for-byte.
4. The vendor-neutral conformance fixtures ensuring third-party parsers interpret records consistently.

## 2. Reproducing Public Package Checks Locally

Any developer, Chartered Accountant, or auditor can reproduce the verification checks for this open-source package locally with **zero external network access**:

```bash
# 1. Run the multi-domain regression suite (11 test suites covering all provisions & failure modes)
npm test

# 2. Run the fail-closed OKF schema & circular frontmatter validator
npm run validate

# 3. Run the vendor-neutral OKF conformance suite (12 fixture assertions)
npm run conformance

# 4. Generate the corpus quality card (Google Data Cards Playbook standard)
npm run quality

# 5. Verify cryptographic SHA-256 Merkle root integrity of all bundled files
npm run manifest:check

# 6. Recompile the statutory catalog from source files
npm run catalog
```

## 3. Cryptographic Integrity vs. Statutory Legal Truth

It is critical to distinguish **byte-level distribution integrity** from **statutory legal ground truth**:

- **What a SHA-256 hash proves**: Byte fidelity. It proves that the downloaded JSON schema or Markdown circular matches the exact byte sequence recorded in the Merkle manifest at publication time, ensuring no corrupted or partial writes.
- **What a SHA-256 hash does NOT prove**: Statutory correctness. A cryptographically intact file can still contain a legally outdated or misconstrued provision.
- **How legal truth is verified**: Every provision must pass our differential test suite (`test.js`) and corpus quality audit (`scripts/corpus_quality_report.js`), verifying calculations against primary Union Gazettes, official CBDT/CBIC circulars, and independent CA legal baselines.

## 4. Differential Test Coverage for Statutory Outcomes

The regression suite (`test.js`) verifies calculations against independently formulated legal baselines across key statutory boundary conditions:

| Provision / Domain | Tested Condition | Legal Ground Truth | Test Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Tax: Section 194Q** | Cumulative purchases cross ₹50L threshold | Deduct 0.1% strictly on excess over ₹50L, NOT on gross | [PASS] Verified |
| **Direct Tax: Section 194Q** | Inoperative or missing vendor PAN | Section 206AA rate capped strictly at 5.0% | [PASS] Verified |
| **Direct Tax: Section 194J** | Technical Services vs. Professional Fees | 2% rate for FTS, 10% rate for professional services | [PASS] Verified |
| **Direct Tax: Section 206C(1H)** | Evaluated on or after 1 April 2025 | Finance Act 2025 sunsets section w.e.f. 01-04-2025 | [PASS] Intercepted |
| **Indirect Tax: CGST Sec 17(5)** | Blocked ITC negative list categories | Motor vehicles <= 13 seats, food/catering, club memberships | [PASS] Blocked |
| **MSME: MSMED Sections 15 & 16** | Payment window & compound penal interest | 15 days default / 45 days written contract; 3x RBI bank rate | [PASS] Verified |
| **Cross-Border: IRC §§ 901/904** | Foreign Tax Credit limitation baskets | Pass-through entity taxes, IRS Schedule K-3 requirement | [PASS] Verified |
| **Corporate M&A: Section 50B** | Slump sale net worth computation & FMV | WDV for depreciable assets, revaluations ignored, 0% GST going concern | [PASS] Verified |
| **Local Resilience (Dead Network)**| Edge query unreachable / simulated dead network | Gracefully falls back to local OKF disk snapshot | [PASS] Verified |
| **Explicit Retrieval Modes** | `mode: 'local'` requested by caller | Fails closed if provision unbundled; 0 network calls | [PASS] Verified |

## 5. Vendor-Neutral OKF Conformance Assertions

The conformance runner (`conformance/test_conformance.js`) tests parser behavior against standalone JSON and Markdown fixtures in `conformance/fixtures/`:

1. **Schema Ingestion**: Minimal valid schemas (`valid_minimal_section.json`) and full metadata schemas (`valid_full_section.json`) accepted.
2. **Temporal Bound Sanity**: Rejects schemas with missing effective dates (`invalid_missing_effective_period.json`) or inverted timelines (`invalid_malformed_temporal_dates.json`).
3. **Mandatory Identity**: Rejects schemas missing `sectionCode` (`invalid_missing_section_code.json`).
4. **Google OKF Frontmatter Extraction**: Correctly extracts YAML frontmatter from administrative circulars (`valid_circular_frontmatter.md`).

## 6. Reproducible Release Tarball Verification

Every published release tarball can be independently verified against Git tag `v2.9.0`:

```bash
# 1. Pack the distribution tarball
npm pack

# 2. Compute the SHA-256 checksum of the tarball (PowerShell)
Get-FileHash mudraforge-statutory-2.9.0.tgz -Algorithm SHA256

# Or in Linux / macOS:
# sha256sum mudraforge-statutory-2.9.0.tgz
```

The resulting package contains exactly 124 audited files (zero extraneous build artifacts, zero internal development scripts).
