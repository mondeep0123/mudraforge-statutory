## Cryptographic & Epistemic Scope

The SHA-256 root hash in `okf/manifest.json` provides mathematical verification of **byte-level integrity** (ensuring local files have not been corrupted, altered, or partially written). A hash certifies that bytes match the published release; it does not by itself constitute legal or statutory authority. 

Epistemic authority is established strictly via:
1. Primary gazette citations and statutory text enacted by Parliament.
2. Executive circulars and notifications issued by the CBDT, CBIC, MCA, and Ministry of MSME.
3. Cryptographic Ed25519 signatures anchored to the MudraForge Root Authority.
4. Independent legal ground-truth test suites parameterizing effective dates and cumulative turnover thresholds.
