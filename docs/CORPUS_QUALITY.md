## 2. Epistemic Quality & Provenance Boundaries

1. **Statutory Text Authority**:
   - The provisions represented in this repository are structured representations of Indian Union Acts, CBDT circulars, CBIC notifications, and US Internal Revenue Code provisions.
   - Primary legal authority resides exclusively in the official **Gazette of India**, **CBDT/CBIC executive notifications**, and official legislative publications.
   - Cryptographic SHA-256 hashes certify **byte-level distribution integrity**, not judicial infallibility.

2. **Temporal Window Modeling**:
   - Every provision models an explicit `validFrom` and `validTo` (or `OPEN_ENDED`).
   - Sunset transitions (such as Section 206C(1H) sunset on 1 April 2025 and Income-tax Act, 1961 sunset on 31 March 2026) are evaluated deterministically at query time.

3. **Dual-Gate Verification**:
   - Every release candidate must pass both:
     - **Gate A (Structural Validation)**: Zero schema lint errors via `npm run validate`.
     - **Gate B (Independent Legal Ground Truth)**: Differential test suite (`test.js`) verifying calculations against independently prepared CA tax baselines.

4. **Four Distinct Levels of Verification Assurance**:
   - **Level 1 (Reachable Source)**: The declared official Gazette, CBDT, or CBIC URL resolves with HTTP 200 (verified by automated crawl).
   - **Level 2 (Text Conformance)**: The statutory threshold numbers, rates, and effective dates in `section.json` correspond directly to the official legislative paragraphs.
   - **Level 3 (Differential Computation)**: The calculation logic is independently executed against edge-case test vectors (e.g. ₹50L excess boundary, inoperative PAN rates) in `test.js`.
   - **Level 4 (Practitioner Review)**: The provision has undergone review by an empanelled Chartered Accountant or legal scholar (indicated in `reviewedBy`).
