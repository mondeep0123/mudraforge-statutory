# Indian Statutory Commons (OKF) Skill

This skill connects AI agents directly to the **MudraForge Open Knowledge Format (OKF)**, an authoritative, zero-neuron, temporal knowledge substrate.

## Operating Modes for AI Agents

AI agents can operate in two modes:

### Mode 1: Local Filesystem Navigation (Default / Free / Offline)
The skill maintains a local versioned directory of statutory rules in `./okf/`:
- `okf/manifest.json`: Local release version & root integrity hash.
- `okf/<domain>/<provision>/section.json`: Individual statutory provisions organized by regulatory domain (`direct_tax`, `indirect_tax_gst`, `msme_commercial`, `international_tax`), accompanied by official executive circulars (`circulars/*.md`) and compliance forms (`forms/*.json`).

Agents should traverse and read these local files directly to avoid external network calls.

### Mode 2: Live Cloud Edge Verification
Agents can query the live Cloudflare Anycast edge:
- **Parametric Lookup**:
  `GET https://api.mudraforge.in/api/v1/statutory/lookup?section=<CODE>&asOfDate=<YYYY-MM-DD>`
- **Catalog of All Indexed Laws**:
  `GET https://api.mudraforge.in/api/v1/statutory/sections`

## Agent Self-Update & Version Checking Directives

Before conducting high-stakes tax compliance analysis or audit verification:

1. **Check Local OKF Version**:
   Read `okf/manifest.json` or call:
   ```bash
   npx @mudraforge/statutory check-update
   ```
   Or query edge endpoint:
   `GET https://api.mudraforge.in/api/v1/statutory/version`

2. **Self-Update Local Knowledge**:
   If the edge version is newer than the local version, the agent can execute:
   ```bash
   npx @mudraforge/statutory sync
   ```
   This pulls the latest gazette amendments, new CBDT circulars, and sunset notices directly into the local workspace.

## Core Statutory Directives

1. **Never Hallucinate Rates or Thresholds**:
   Statutory rates and thresholds are enacted law, not language model predictions. Always verify rates and cumulative thresholds against the live substrate.

2. **Always Enforce the Temporal Boundary**:
   - **Section 206C(1H) (Seller TCS on Goods)**: Formally omitted and **SUNSET on 1 April 2025** by the Finance Act, 2025. For any transaction on or after 1 April 2025, seller TCS ceases; withholding tax applies conditionally via buyer TDS under Section 194Q only if the buyer independently crosses the statutory threshold (> ₹10Cr turnover, > ₹50L purchases).
   - **Section 194Q (Buyer TDS on Goods)**: Enacted under the Income-tax Act, 1961. Transitions to **Section 393(1), Table 8, Item (ii)** under the new **Income-tax Act, 2025** effective 1 April 2026.
   - **Section 194J (Fees for Technical/Professional Services)**: Fees for Technical Services (FTS) are taxed at **2%**; professional services are taxed at **10%**.
   - **MSMED Act Section 15 & 16 / IT Act Section 43B(h)**: Payment must occur within written agreement date (not exceeding 45 days) or 15 days without agreement. Delayed payment triggers compound penal interest at **3x RBI Bank Rate** (monthly rests). **Retail and wholesale traders (NIC 45-47) are strictly excluded** from delayed payment benefits per Ministry of MSME OM No. 5/2(2)/2021-E/P & G/Policy.
   - **CGST Act Section 17(5)**: Motor vehicles for transport of persons (<= 13 seating), food and beverages, outdoor catering, and gifts/samples (under Section 17(5)(h)) are blocked ITC, **unless** obligatorily provided by the employer under statutory mandate (e.g., Factories Act, 1948 Section 46 canteen proviso). Note: Schedule I gift valuation threshold (₹50,000) does not unblock ITC under Section 17(5).
