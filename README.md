Install and run locally in any Node.js 18+, Bun, or Deno environment with **zero network requests and zero API keys required**:

```bash
npm install @mudraforge/statutory
```

```javascript
import { 
  lookupStatute, 
  calculateCorporateTaxMatVsConcessional, 
  evaluatePlaceOfSupplyAndLut,
  isStatuteActive

## Overview: Why We Open-Source Adesha's Statutory Substrate

In enterprise finance, no CFO, audit committee, or enterprise risk officer will permit an autonomous AI agent to propose payment instructions or touch the corporate general ledger if its tax withholding and regulatory logic is an opaque, black-box prompt. Large language models hallucinate tax rates, invert statutory obligations, and defend computational errors (*Rule 11: Agreement with the Engine ≠ Agreement with the Law*).

**MudraForge Adesha** resolves this through deliberate architectural separation:

1. **The Open Trust Anchor (This Package — `@mudraforge/statutory`)**: The deterministic statutory substrate. It structures 29 primary laws across 5 regulatory domains under Google's Open Knowledge Format (OKF v0.2), provides 7 pure mathematical calculators, and verifies legal ground truth with cryptographic Merkle integrity—100% offline with zero dependencies. Anyone can inspect, test, fork, or embed this layer freely in their own financial applications.
2. **The Governed Execution Platform (Adesha Enterprise Runtime)**: When an organization deploys Adesha, it receives the complete autonomous finance AI system: multimodal invoice interpretation, 3-way PO matching, deterministic statutory validation, single-use cryptographic payment leases, CFO biometric approval, host-to-host bank rail settlement, and balanced double-entry ERP general ledger writebacks (Zoho Books, SAP S/4HANA, NetSuite).

> **The Core Thesis of Autonomous Finance**:  
> *Reasoning can be probabilistic, but financial execution needs deterministic boundaries.*  
> Knowing what the law says is not the same as having authority to disburse funds. This package guarantees statutory truth; Adesha governs consequential execution.

> For cryptographic root digests, normative specifications, and formal assurance artifacts, see [docs/PROVENANCE.md](./docs/PROVENANCE.md).  
> For the enterprise execution platform architecture, see [docs/ENTERPRISE_GOVERNANCE.md](./docs/ENTERPRISE_GOVERNANCE.md).  
> To test Adesha against your historical accounting records in read-only shadow mode, see [docs/PILOT_EVALUATION_GUIDE.md](./docs/PILOT_EVALUATION_GUIDE.md).

## Supported Application Patterns

`@mudraforge/statutory` serves as an authoritative reference layer and computation client across three distinct environments:

### 1. AI Agents & LLM Tooling
- **Current Implementation**: Generates a self-contained [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) skill definition (`npx @mudraforge/statutory init-skill`) that connects agent runtimes directly to the local filesystem without external API calls or token bloat from search queries.
- **Integration Boundary**: Agents can read structured section definitions (`okf/**/section.json`) to discover rates, thresholds, and return filing schemas deterministically rather than relying on model parameter memory.

### 2. Finance Software & Accounts-Payable Workflows
- **Current Implementation**: Provides offline threshold logic (such as Section 194Q cumulative purchases exceeding ₹50 Lakhs) and legislative sunsets (Section 206C(1H) omission on 1 April 2025). The hosted enterprise tier provides deterministic calculation via `client.calculate()`.
- **Integration Boundary**: Custom accounting engines or enterprise middleware can invoke these functions via Node.js or REST endpoints. *(Note: This package exposes standard programmatic and JSON interfaces; it does not ship pre-packaged ERP plugins for third-party platforms).*

### 3. Developer Tooling & Audit Verification
- **Current Implementation**: CLI commands (`browse`, `lookup`, `list`, `check-update`) allow developers and tax compliance teams to inspect verified primary citations, download statutory checklists (such as Form 3CEA slump sale audit requirements), and verify dual-act forward crosswalks between the 1961 and 2025 Income-tax Acts.
- **Integration Boundary**: Usable standalone in terminal environments, continuous integration (CI) compliance checks, or custom tax tooling.

## Separation of Statutory Knowledge from Autonomous Execution

A fundamental design invariant of MudraForge is: **Knowing what the law says is not the same as having authority to disburse corporate funds.**

- **The Open-Source Commons (`@mudraforge/statutory`)**: Provides declarative statutory truth, temporal boundaries, and pure deterministic calculators. All functions enforce `isAuthorizedToDisburse: false`. Calculation never authorizes autonomous money movement.
- **The Governed Execution Platform (Adesha)**: Manages consequential real-world operations—single-use payment authorization leases, dual-custody mobile authorization, banking rail integration, and balanced ERP general ledger writebacks.

> For complete enterprise architecture specifications, TLC model checking proofs, and the 7-stage AP governance lifecycle, see [docs/ENTERPRISE_GOVERNANCE.md](./docs/ENTERPRISE_GOVERNANCE.md).  
> To run a local simulation of the modeled 7-stage AP trace: `npm run example:trace`.

## Statutory Authority & Epistemic Boundary

- **Primary Legislation & Official Circulars**: Statutory texts, executive circulars, notifications, and compliance forms in this repository are structured transpositions of official publications issued by the Ministry of Finance (CBDT/CBIC), Ministry of MSME, Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), and the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Official government source material remains the sole statutory authority.
- **Open Knowledge Format (OKF v0.2) & Companion Model**: This repository implements Google's Open Knowledge Format (OKF v0.2) for portable knowledge publication (Markdown circulars, YAML frontmatter, trust anchors, and `okf.publication.json`). It extends the format with the **MudraForge Statutory Schema Extension** (`section.json`, `forms/*.json`) to capture strict transactional threshold parameters, tax rate determinants, and dual-act mappings needed by accounting software and autonomous agents.
- **Deterministic Runtime Separation**: Mathematical execution (cumulative threshold deductions, multi-interval monthly compound interest, double-entry ledger writebacks, and single-use payment leases) is evaluated independently by the MudraForge Adesha Governance Engine on Cloudflare Anycast Edge. Reference metadata published in this package does not constitute formal legal counsel or statutory audit certification.

---

## Project Identity, Audience & Non-Goals

### Purpose & Intended Audience
`@mudraforge/statutory` publishes an open, machine-readable statutory knowledge substrate for software engineers building financial AI agents (Antigravity, Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot), ERP integration teams (Tally, SAP, Zoho Books, NetSuite), Chartered Accountants, and compliance automation engineers.

### What OKF Compatibility Means
Provisions in this repository adhere to the **Open Knowledge Format (OKF v0.2)** specification:
- **Declarative Knowledge**: Legal rules are structured into clean, machine-readable JSON (`section.json`), official administrative circulars with YAML frontmatter (`.md`), and compliance return schemas.
- **Companion Extension**: While Google's OKF v0.2 standardizes Markdown-based knowledge with YAML frontmatter, MudraForge provides a companion data model (`section.json`) to express transactional tax thresholds, rate structures, and dual-act cross-compilation maps.
- **Temporal State Machines**: Strict `validFrom`, `validTo`, and `annualReset` boundaries preventing retrospective hallucination and catching legislative sunsets (e.g. Section 206C(1H) sunset on 1 April 2025).
- **Trust Anchors**: Every provision binds to authoritative primary sources: the Gazette of India, CBDT/CBIC executive circulars, or Ministry notifications (`incometax.gov.in`, `cbic-gst.gov.in`, `msme.gov.in`, `irs.gov.in`).
- **Cryptographic Provenance**: Bundled files are verifiable against a deterministic SHA-256 Merkle root hash.

### Explicit Non-Goals
1. **Not Legal or Tax Advice**: This package structures public legal instruments into machine-readable data. It does not provide formal legal counsel, tax opinions, or statutory audit certification.
2. **Not a Universal Legal Library**: Unlike broad legal repositories (*IndiaCode*, *Open India Law*), this project does not compile general civil, criminal, or constitutional case law. It focuses strictly on **transactional finance, direct/indirect taxation, and commercial AP compliance**.
3. **Not an ERP or Payment Rail**: This package provides declarative ground truth to AI agents and software pipelines; it does not store accounting ledgers, move money, or replace enterprise ERPs.

## Rationale: Authoritative Knowledge Substrate vs. Probabilistic Web RAG

When autonomous AI agents and developer applications (Cursor, Claude, Copilot, Antigravity, or custom enterprise finance systems) evaluate Indian and cross-border tax compliance, they typically face two systemic failure modes:

1. **Frozen, Outdated Model Weights**: Foundation models hallucinate rates, cite provisions repealed in prior Finance Acts, or invert statutory withholding obligations (such as continuing to mandate Section 206C(1H) collection following its statutory omission on 1 April 2025).
2. **Unstructured Web Search (Web RAG)**: When agents search the public web for statutory sections, they ingest conflicting third-party summaries: commercial search-engine-optimized blogs from 2018–2022, unverified discussion forums, and marketing writeups that omit crucial legislative provisos (such as CBDT Circular 13/2021 unbundling GST from the TDS base, or Ministry of MSME OM 2/1(5)/2021 strictly excluding retail and wholesale traders). This consumes excessive context tokens, introduces 3–5 seconds of latency, and feeds noisy, contradictory context into the reasoning loop.

`@mudraforge/statutory` resolves this by providing an **unambiguous, structured, offline-capable statutory knowledge vault** under Google's Open Knowledge Format (OKF v0.2). Provisions are organized with definitive section codes, operative dates, legislative sunset boundaries, primary citations, thresholds, and audit checklists.

---

## Architectural Principle: Separation of Law & Deterministic Computation

A foundational rule of financial systems: **Providing an LLM with the raw text of a statute does NOT ensure the model will compute or enforce it correctly.**

Large Language Models are probabilistic token sequence predictors, not deterministic arithmetic processors. When an LLM evaluates Section 194Q ("deduct 0.1% on purchase of goods exceeding ₹50 Lakhs"):
- It frequently computes 0.1% on the aggregate transaction value rather than the incremental excess over ₹50 Lakhs.
- It fails to calculate monthly compound penal interest at 3 times the RBI Bank Rate under MSMED Act Sections 15 & 16 across multi-quarter intervals.
- When challenged on computational mistakes, generative models defend erroneous figures due to the **Epistemic Confirmation Loop** (*"Agreement is not truth"*).

**To resolve this, MudraForge enforces a strict Separation of Powers**:
- **The Free OKF Commons (This Package)** provides the declarative knowledge representation: verified statutory thresholds, legal summaries, executive circulars, and compliance return schemas.
- **The Paid Cloud Engine** provides the **deterministic calculation engines**, System-1 semantic intent discovery, and multi-step statutory verification on Cloudflare Anycast Edge. Statutory arithmetic is never delegated to generative token prediction.

---

## System Origin & Validation Baseline

`@mudraforge/statutory` publishes the declarative statutory rules, executive circulars, and return schemas developed internally at MudraForge to feed its autonomous finance engine (Adesha). 

It is currently released as a **Public Beta**. The bundled schemas and temporal state machines have been verified internally against synthetic mutation suites, historical enterprise AP audit samples, and Chartered Accountant peer reviews before publication. It has not yet been subjected to third-party high-volume client production workloads, which is why we invite independent evaluation, verification, and community contributions.

## Legal Domains Currently Covered

> **Full 11-Domain Roadmap & Lifecycle Matrix**:  
> For the complete architectural matrix comparing the 4 starter domains against the full 11-domain sovereign roadmap (including Indian Accounting Standards [Ind AS], MCA Corporate Governance, and SEBI LODR), see [`docs/DOMAIN_BREADTH_AND_DEPTH_COMPARISON.md`](./docs/DOMAIN_BREADTH_AND_DEPTH_COMPARISON.md).

The OKF substrate currently indexes and enforces ground truth across five major regulatory domains:

### 1. Direct Tax (Income Tax & TDS/TCS)
- **Section 194Q**: 0.1% TDS on purchase of goods exceeding ₹50 Lakhs cumulative annual threshold (calculating strictly on the excess).
- **Section 206C(1H)**: TCS on sale of goods, with automated temporal interception of its **1 April 2025 sunset** under the Finance Act, 2025.
- **Section 194C**: Payments to contractors and sub-contractors (1% individuals, 2% companies/LLPs), single-invoice ₹30,000 / aggregate ₹1,00,000 thresholds, transporter 10-carriage exemption.
- **Section 194J**: Fees for Technical Services (2% FTS) vs. Professional Fees (10%), enforcing standard 20% non-PAN penalty rate under Section 206AA(1)(iii) / Section 397(2)(a).
- **Section 194I**: Rent withholding (2% plant & machinery, 10% land & building) exceeding ₹2.4 Lakhs annual threshold.
- **Section 194H**: Commission and brokerage withholding (2% amended rate w.e.f. 1 October 2024) exceeding ₹15,000 threshold.
- **Dual-Act Forward Mapping**: Complete cross-compilation bridge from the legacy *Income-tax Act, 1961* to the *Income-tax Act, 2025* (which took effect 1 April 2026), mapping historical provisions seamlessly (e.g., Section 194Q $\rightarrow$ Section 393(1), Table 8, Item (ii)).

### 2. Indirect Tax (Goods & Services Tax - GST)
- **CGST Section 8**: Composite and mixed supplies—naturally bundled supplies taxed at the principal supply rate under Section 8(a); unbundled supplies billed for a single price taxed at the highest rate under Section 8(b).
- **CGST Section 9(3)**: Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM)—mandatory tax discharge by recipient strictly via Electronic Cash Ledger for notified categories (GTA, legal services, directors, security), self-invoicing under Section 31(3)(f), payment vouchers under Section 31(3)(g), and subsequent Section 16(2) ITC re-availment.
- **CGST Section 16(2)**: Core statutory conditions for availing Input Tax Credit (clauses a-d), mandatory supplier communication under Section 37/38 (GSTR-2B), Rule 37 180-day vendor payment reversal with Section 50 interest reported in Table 4(B)(2), subsequent re-availment in Table 4(A)(5) and Table 4(D)(1), RCM statutory exceptions, and Section 16(4) annual cutoff.
- **CGST Section 17(5)**: Comprehensive statutory negative list for Blocked Input Tax Credit (ITC)—including motor vehicles, catering, employee benefits, and the statutory employer obligation proviso under CBIC Circular 172/04/2022-GST.

### 3. Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME & Commercial)
- **MSMED Act, 2006 (Sections 15 & 16)**: Strict statutory payment clock (15 days without agreement, max 45 days with written agreement) and non-negotiable compound penal interest at **3 times the RBI Bank Rate** (compounded monthly).
- **Trader Exclusion Rule**: Automated enforcement of Ministry of MSME OM No. 1/4(1)/2021-P&G/Policy, strictly excluding wholesale and retail traders (NIC 45, 46, 47) from delayed payment protections and Section 43B(h) addbacks.
- **MCA Form MSME-1**: Companies Act, 2013 Section 405 mandatory half-yearly return (due October 31 & April 30) for trade payables outstanding beyond 45 days.
- **Section 22 & Schedule III Disclosures**: 5-point statutory Notes to Accounts, Trade Payables aging schedule (<1yr, 1-2yr, 2-3yr, >3yr), and Section 23 tax deduction add-back.
- **Section 7 Composite Classification**: Micro, Small, and Medium classification criteria (Investment + Turnover) with mandatory statutory deduction of export turnover under Notification S.O. 2119(E).

### 4. Cross-Border & International Tax
- **Section 195 & DTAA**: Outbound cross-border remittances to non-residents, Section 90(2) treaty rates, Tax Residency Certificate (TRC) Section 90(4), electronic Form 10F, Rule 37BB Form 15CA/15CB banking gate, and Supreme Court *Engineering Analysis* cloud SaaS royalty exemption.
- **US Internal Revenue Code (IRC §§ 901 & 904)**: Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) limitation baskets (General Category vs. Passive Category), Pass-Through Entity (PTE) tax pass-throughs, and Schedule K-3 dual-reporting compliance for Indo-US cross-border ventures.
- **Indian Rule 128 (Form 67)**: Statement of foreign tax credit compliance schema and filing deadlines.

### 5. Corporate M&A & Restructuring
- **Section 50B (Slump Sale)**: Capital gains computation on slump sale of undertakings based on Written Down Value (WDV) net worth under Section 43(6), Form 3CEA CA certification schema, and Section 281/313 tax clearance due diligence checklists.

## Canonical Edge Synchronization (Full Statutory Universe)

The package bundles an initial curated baseline snapshot across all four domains. **To pull the complete, continually expanding statutory catalog from the Cloudflare Anycast edge API into your local workspace:**

```bash
# Step 1: Check if newer statutes, circulars, or gazette amendments exist on the edge
npx @mudraforge/statutory check-update

# Step 2: Synchronize the complete statutory bundle directly to your local ./okf/ directory
npx @mudraforge/statutory sync

# Step 3: Browse your full local statutory library interactively
npx @mudraforge/statutory browse
```

---

## Quick Start (Free Tier)

### 1. Installation via npm
```bash
npm install @mudraforge/statutory
```

### 2. Initialize AI Agent Skill
Installs `SKILL.md` into your workspace's `.agents/skills/` directory:
```bash
npx @mudraforge/statutory init-skill
```

### 3. Direct Programmatic Traversal (Zero Dependencies, Offline-First)
```javascript
import { lookupLocalStatute, isStatuteActive } from '@mudraforge/statutory';

// 1. Look up Section 194Q from local disk (0 network calls, direct filesystem read)
const statute = lookupLocalStatute('194Q');
console.log(statute.title);
console.log(statute.keyStatutoryThresholds.taxableBaseScope);
// => "Tax is deductible strictly on the excess over ₹50 Lakhs, NOT on the aggregate gross turnover."

// 2. Check temporal status (detecting legislative sunsets)
const isActive2024 = await isStatuteActive('206C(1H)', '2024-05-01'); // true
const isActive2025 = await isStatuteActive('206C(1H)', '2025-06-01'); // false (omitted by Finance Act, 2025)
```

### 4. CLI Verification, Auditing & Pipeline Integration

The CLI provides cryptographic provenance checking, offline integrity verification, and machine-readable JSON output for CI/CD audit pipelines:

```bash
# Run full environment, local substrate health, and edge latency diagnostics
npx @mudraforge/statutory doctor

# Force air-gapped / offline diagnostics (zero outbound network requests)
npx @mudraforge/statutory doctor --offline

# Cryptographically verify local statutory substrate integrity & origin authenticity
npx @mudraforge/statutory verify

# Dual-act 1961 <-> 2025 statutory crosswalk (earlier of credit vs payment)
npx @mudraforge/statutory crosswalk 194Q --credit 2026-03-25 --payment 2026-04-10

# Reverse crosswalk from 2025 Act provision
npx @mudraforge/statutory crosswalk 393 --date 2025-08-01

# Query semantic regulatory changelog and amendment tracker
npx @mudraforge/statutory diff --section 194H

#### Custom MudraForge Exit Code Contract
Calling pipelines and CI/CD audit steps can inspect `$?` directly:

| Exit Code | Classification | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | `SUCCESS` | Substrate verified authentic, intact, and all baseline provisions present. |
| `1` | `USAGE_OR_OPERATIONAL_ERROR` | Invalid CLI arguments, unknown command, or syntax error. |
| `2` | `INTEGRITY_OR_SECURITY_VIOLATION` | Cryptographic signature failure, unpinned root hash, file tampering, or revoked key. |
| `3` | `STATUTORY_POLICY_VIOLATION` | Statutory policy failure (e.g. missing mandatory baseline provision or sunset violation). |

## Commercial & Enterprise Platform Ecosystem

`@mudraforge/statutory` is the open-source, zero-dependency statutory ground-truth substrate of the MudraForge ecosystem. For organizations requiring consequential financial execution, hosted agent tools, or managed infrastructure:

### 1. Governed Execution Platform (MudraForge Adesha)
While `@mudraforge/statutory` calculates what the law requires, **Adesha** governs real-world financial execution:
- **Single-Use Payment Authorization Leases**: Atomic Compare-and-Swap (CAS) leases cryptographically bound to invoice hash, vendor legal entity, and authorized net wire amount.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Authority Harness**: Maker-checker workflows requiring CFO biometric passkey approval.
- **Host-to-Host Banking Rail Integration**: Dispatches payouts via corporate banking gateways with signed webhook verification and clearinghouse reversal interception.
- **ERP General Ledger Writebacks**: Automatically posts balanced double-entry vouchers to Zoho Books, SAP S/4HANA, or NetSuite upon settlement confirmation.
- *Detailed Architecture*: See [docs/ENTERPRISE_GOVERNANCE.md](./docs/ENTERPRISE_GOVERNANCE.md).

### 2. Hosted Model Context Protocol (MCP) Infrastructure
In accordance with our commercial boundary protocol:
- **Enterprise-Tier Tooling**: Hosted Model Context Protocol (MCP) server endpoints and live multi-agent tool connectivity are strictly commercial/enterprise features.
- **Enterprise Setup**: Connecting MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, or Antigravity) connects to enterprise-licensed infrastructure and requires an Enterprise API Key.
- Contact: `hello@mudraforge.in` / `support@mudraforge.in`.

### 3. Hosted Edge API & Continuous Synchronization
- **Hosted Edge Calculation (`/api/v1/statutory/calculate`)**: Optional cloud-hosted calculation service on Cloudflare Anycast edge for organizations integrating via REST rather than the Node.js package.
- **Continuous Regulatory Sync**: SLA-backed automated updates tracking Gazette of India notifications, CBDT circulars, and Finance Act amendments.

## A Note from the Maintainer

Hi, I am Mondeep Engti, the founder of MudraForge and the current maintainer of `@mudraforge/statutory`.

I am building this project because I believe that statutory compliance knowledge—the rules that govern commercial trade, taxation, MSME working capital, and enterprise accountability—should not be locked inside expensive proprietary silos or hallucinated by ungrounded black-box AI models. It should be open, machine-readable, and mathematically verifiable by anyone.

This repository is part of a deliberate two-tier architecture:
1. **The Public Commons (`@mudraforge/statutory`)**: Provides declarative, zero-dependency statutory ground truth under Google's Open Knowledge Format (OKF v0.2) with cryptographic Merkle verification. It is 100% free, inspectable, and locally usable for developers, researchers, and Chartered Accountants.
2. **The Commercial Platform (Adesha)**: Builds on top of this foundation to deliver an autonomous enterprise finance runtime—providing deterministic calculation engines, two-way ERP reconciliation, and single-use cryptographic payment leases governed by human authorization.

**This project is currently maintained by a solo founder.** That means development velocity, review capacity, and update cadences have real limits. The hosted edge sync is provided on a best-effort basis, while the bundled local package is guaranteed to remain fully functional offline indefinitely.

I open-sourced this layer because critical financial infrastructure benefits from public inspection, adversarial testing, and community contributions. Whether you are an engineer building financial AI agents, a Chartered Accountant auditing tax withholding, or a compliance practitioner, your feedback, pull requests, and bug reports are genuinely welcome.

If you are working on autonomous financial systems or want to discuss the roadmap, you can reach me directly at **mondeepe@gmail.com** or **hello@mudraforge.in**.
